# NSE-India-scrape
These are 2 programs I have made to scrape the National Stock Exchange India website. Here, I implemented 2 strategies to go by. 

In the first code, I have used the Beautiful Soup library to scrape the contents of the live market section. In this code, I have fetched the details of the stock, the company information (corporate announcements, board meetings and corporate actions), peer comparison and historical data from the website and make dictionaries of them. Then I exported them csv files.

In the second code, I have used Selenium library for automation using Python to scrape the company tracker section of the website. In this code, I have fetched company information, corporate actions, announcements, price watch, financial results, board meetings and trade history. I have made dictionaries and dataframes of the extracted data and exported them to csv files locally.
